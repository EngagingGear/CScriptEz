CScriptEz is a program that allows you to write script files in C# rather than the ugly alternatives like powershell or cmd scripts. After you install the program you can write scripts with the csez extension and double click them to run the script.

The script is compiled and immediaely run. To reduce the run time it does, optionally, cache the compiled scripts (and deals with changes seamlessly).

Documentation for this software, including how to install and use is to be found <a href="https://github.com/EngagingGear/CScriptEz/wiki/CScriptEz-Documentation">here</a>.
